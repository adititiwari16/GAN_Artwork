# GAN_Artwork
## CONCLUSION

In the evaluation of the model: We can see that the GAN picked up the patterns in the portraits. It worked quite well. For further improvement,  as GANs are notorious for being data-hungry, I would consider increasing the dataset. There are many inconsistencies in the data which is rather complicated for the GAN to learn. Cleaning the data with some consistencies in the portrait styles would certainly help. Training it longer i.e. for more epochs would also help. Lastly, one can always strive to make a  more robust architecture for the Neural Networks.
